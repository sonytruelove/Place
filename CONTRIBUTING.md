You can see examples in existing commits!

## <a name="coding_review"></a>Code review process ü§ó


We all make mistakes and bad coding decisions. So apart from the obvious fixes, all changes must be reviewed. This also helps with the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) - there should always be other people in the team who know why a change was made.

Afterwards you can merge the pull request if you have rights, or another person must do it for you.

Your pull request must:

 * Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality.
 * Use clear commit messages
 * Contain a clean history of small, incremental, logically separate commits,
   with no merge commits..
 * Be possible to merge automatically.
