## <a name="GR"></a>Ground Rules üåÑ 

    *Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
    *Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
    *Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## <a name="getting_started"></a>Getting startedüèÉ 

1. Decide what you will work on and **assign** it (Start with issue that have a "good first issue" label)
2. **Create** your own **fork** of the code
3. Do the *change* in your *fork*
4. Create a **pull request**

## <a name="coding_rules"></a>Coding Rules üé©

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

  *All public API methods must be documented.

  *We follow [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), but be carefully with ESlint.

You can see examples in existing commits!

## <a name="coding_review"></a>Code review process ü§ó


We all make mistakes and bad coding decisions. So apart from the obvious fixes, all changes must be reviewed. This also helps with the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) - there should always be other people in the team who know why a change was made.

Afterwards you can merge the pull request if you have rights, or another person must do it for you.

Your pull request must:

 * Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality.
 * Use clear commit messages
 * Contain a clean history of small, incremental, logically separate commits,
   with no merge commits..
 * Be possible to merge automatically.
